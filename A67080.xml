            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Moſt Eaſie Method For Making The Beſt Cyder.</head>
            <p>IT is generally known, That few Foreign Drinks as they are handed
to us, are comparable to our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh <hi>Cyder</hi> well made: Thoſe being
ſo adulterated in the ſeveral hands through which they paſs, that they
corrupt inſtead of repair, the Natures of them that drink them. By
<hi>Cyder</hi> well made, hath been found to be a much more excellent and
ſalubrous Liquor, and more ſuitable to our Engliſh Bodies, than any of
thoſe corrupt and adulterated Wines that are daily conſumed.
Nevertheleſs, the different and erroneous Methods that are us'd in making of
it, (which like Medicines for Agues, are become innumerable, and rather
confound than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Judgment) through the Ignorance of ſome, and the
Covetouſneſs of others, have very much impaired its Reputation; and rendred
this Liquor not ſo univerſally<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93773:3"/>acceptable as it might be,
if made of the moſt proper Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for that purpoſe, and duly prepared.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, to undeceive the too credulous, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the
Curious, and ſuch that are willing to promote ſo good a Work as the
improvement of ſo excellent a Liquor, and ſo great a part of our Engliſh
Husbandry. I intend here to give you ſuch an eaſie Method for making the
beſt <hi>Cyder,</hi> as <hi>Experience</hi> the <hi>Miſtris</hi> of
<hi>Arts</hi> hath taught; that inſtead of a laborious and difficult way of
compounding and corrupting, you may naturally and eaſily make it: And if
rightly obſerved and followed, will cauſe this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor to be ſo generally
eſteem'd, that in a little time it may ſupplant the ſhallow credit of the
ſophiſticated exotic blood of the Grape.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I. The Choice of the Fruit.</head>
               <p n="1">§ 1. APples that are hard and laſting make good
<hi>Cyder,</hi> although their parenchymous or fleſhy parts are White, as the
<hi>Deux-Ans,</hi> or <hi>John-Apples, Oaken-pins, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Apples,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons are, that they hang long on the Trees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they
are Ripe, which digeſteth their Juice the more, and are or ought to be, kept
longer than ſofter Fruit after they are gathered, before they are ground, for
the ſame intent: And their tough Skin preſerves their copious Spirits from
perſpiration, more than in tender Fruits.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. Such whoſe Parenchymous, or freſhy parts are
Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and Firm, yield very good <hi>Cyder,</hi> whether they be Ripe early or
late; although the later they are Ripe, the richer Liquor they yield: As
<hi>Pippins</hi> of all ſorts, eſpecially the <hi>Golden, Orange Apple,
Golden Rennets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93773:3"/>The Redneſs is cauſed by the heat of the
Sun digeſting the Liquid matter on the extream parts of the Fruit. It alſo
giveth a Tincture to the <hi>Cyder;</hi> as the red Skin of the Grape doth to
Wine. The outſide of any Apple yieldeth the beſt <hi>Cyder;</hi> but the
more coloured the better.</p>

            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II. The Times for Gathering and Grinding Apples for
<hi>Cyder.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">§ 1. MAny Judge of the ripeneſs of Apples by the
blackneſs of the Kernels.</p>
               <p>This holdeth in Fruits that are not long laſting, but in
ſome Apples that hang long on the Trees, they muſt be taken before the
Froſts hurt them, although the Kernels are not through Black.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. The maturity of ſome Fruit is diſcern'd by
their yellow Colour; which with the blackneſs of their Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, is a good
indication.</p>
               <p>But ſome Apples are white when through Ripe, and improve not
their Colour till they have lain ſometime gathered; and ſome are yellow
before they are Ripe.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Moſt Apples diſcover their maturity by their
Scent; for if they have a Mellow ſmell, they are undoubtedly ripe enough to
gather.</p>
               <p>Some Apples nevertheleſs, yield no Scent, or very little,
whilſt on the Trees: but theſe have other indications of their
Maturity.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. When Apples are apt Spontaneouſly to drop from
the Trees, they are undoubtedly Ripe: For then the Tree<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93773:4"/>ceaſeth to give any more nouriſhment to the Fruit, by means
whereof, the Ligaments by which the Fruit is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Tree, and receiveth
its nouriſhment, grow fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in a little time are diſſolv'd.</p>
               <p>Some Winter-Fruits there are, that are ſo ſtrongly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Trees, that the Fruit is many times preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by Froſts before their
Ligaments are diſſolv'd; therefore they muſt be gathered before the
extream Cold invades them.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. Therefore by theſe indications, or ſome of
them, it is not difficult to know when it is fit to gather your Fruits. When
they are gathered, it is convenient to let them lye on heaps, or in Veſſels
within Doors, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where out of the Rain, for ſome time before they are
fit for the Mill; for the lying of Apples ſometime after they are taken from
the Trees, begets the expence of the more phlegmatick Juice by Sweating, and
ripens and meliorates that which remains; and alſo weakneth (by a degree of
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction) the Branchery or Veins that ſo ſtrongly unite the
Parenchymous parts of the Fruit, making them more eaſily to be broken in the
Mill, and more freely yield their Juices.</p>
               <p>Such Fruits that are ripe before, or about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi>
may lye two or three Weeks: And thoſe that are not ripe till after, may lye
till <hi>November,</hi> as <hi>Gilliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Marigold Apples, &amp;c.</hi>
Some till <hi>December,</hi> as <hi>Deux-ans, Weſtbury Apples, Oaken-pins,
&amp;c.</hi> And then will they yield the more and better <hi>Cyder,</hi> which
if they ſhould be ground ſoon after their gathering, they would yield a
thin acid Juice not fit for uſe.</p>

               <head>III. The manner of grinding and preſſing of Apples for
<hi>Cyder.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">§ 1. THe beſt Mills for grinding are thoſe
deſcribed in <hi>Vinetum Britannicum,</hi> being the moſt expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and
advantagious way for the good of the Liquor, that hath been yet
diſcovered.</p>
               <p>One Man may grind as many Apples in a Day by one of theſe
Mills, as are uſually ground in two or three Horſe-Mills in the ſame
time.</p>
               <p>A Horſe-Mill will coſt near 20 <hi>l.</hi> the ſetting up,
with the Room wherein it is to be uſed. One of the leaſt of theſe Mills,
wherein may be ground neer 20 Buſhels in an Hour, will not coſt above 3
<hi>l.</hi> The larger and ſwifter more.</p>
               <p>A Horſe Mill is fixt, and will take up a great deal of room,
and muſt remain ſo from year to year. But either of theſe Mills ſtand
in a little Room, and is moveable and portable from place to place with
eaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. After the Apples are ground, if they were
mellow, it is good to preſs the Pulp the ſame day they were ground, or the
next day after. But if the Apples were hard or tough, then let the Pulp ſtand
two or three days.</p>
               <p>For the Pulp of Mellow Apples is apt to heat ſooner than
other, and thereby contract an ill Savour; but that of harder Fruit is not; and
the ſtanding ſome time after they are ground, makes it yield the more
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, by diſſolving the more obdurate Particles, and weakning the
Branchery or Veins that paſs through the whole fleſhy parts thereof, by an
advantagious degree of Putrefaction: By which means it's Guſt is improved,
and it's Tincture exalted, eſpecially if made of coloured Fruit.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93773:5"/>§ 3. If you deſire a rich
coloured <hi>Cyder,</hi> take of the reddeſt ſort of through ripe
<hi>Gilliflowers</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> and pill about a third or fourth
part of them you intend to grind, and when you have ground and preſſed your
<hi>Cyder,</hi> add the pillings to the <hi>Cyder,</hi> and ſo let it ſtand
Fourteen days more or leſs, then decant or draw off the <hi>Cyder,</hi> and
preſs the pillings to it, and order it as hereafter is directed, and you will
have the fineſt, beſt coloured <hi>Cyder,</hi> and richeſt in
ſubſtance and taſte that can be made of Apples: More eſpecially if you
pill all your Gilliflowers, or deep coloured Apples about the thickneſs of a
Crown-piece, and grind thoſe thick Rinds very fine (laying by the Inſides
you left, to make a meaner <hi>Cyder</hi>) and then digeſt that
<hi>Cyder</hi> on ſome of the thin Pillings.</p>
               <p>For all Vinous Fruits have their pureſt part next the skin or
pill, and there is the richeſt Juice contained, the Sun or Air maturating
ſuch Juice more perfectly on the extream parts, than near the Core: The Pores
are alſo much finer there than towards the middle, as appears in a
diſſected Apple by the help of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope; which is the reaſon that
Wines proceeding from Grapes lying in large Veſſels without any other
Preſſure than their own Weight, are much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than thoſe that
are forcibly expreſſed, which by all are found to be the pooreſt.
Therefore if you intend to have good <hi>Cyder</hi> of any ſort of Fruit,
preſs not your Pulp too hard, as it is uſually done in the great
Screw-Preſſes, ſome of them being made with Iron Screws, by force whereof
the Murc is ſometimes left ſo dry, that it will burn. This <hi>Cyder</hi>
ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is ill coloured, and not well taſted, for the laſt run
is poor, and carryeth with it too much of the lignous part of the Apple (the
inſide or coary part of the Apple, as well as the ſtony part of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93773:5"/>Grape being the more rough and harſh) therefore it is
better to leave a part of that behind, than to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh ten times as much
of that which is more pure and rich. Beſides, it confounds the Specifick
Guſt and Flavour that <hi>Cyder</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ould have of the Fruit its made
of, making all <hi>Cyder</hi> almoſt taſte alike. And when you intend to
make <hi>Ciderkin,</hi> an eaſie Preſſure leaves the more behind to
improve that, which is none of the meaneſt Drinks.</p>

Barrels, Hogſheads, or other Veſſels, which place in your coldeſt
Cellars, Vaults, or places, and there let them ſtand with their Bungs open
three or four Weeks, or more, till the Feces or Lee preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, and your
<hi>Cyder</hi> become indifferently fine.</p>
               <p>If you have not a Vatt or Tun fit for your purpoſe, you may
ſtrain it from its Traſh, and Barrel it up im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the Preſs;
but beſure to ſet it in the coldeſt places; for Cold conduceth very much
to the purifying of this Liquor, Warmth occaſioning the ſolution and
detention of thoſe Particles of flying Lee, that ſpoil the Colour and
Taſte of <hi>Cyder,</hi> which otherwiſe would precipitate. The leaving the
Bung open doth not only add to the cooling of the Liquor,<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93773:6"/>but
gives way to the expence of the wild Spirit that is in it, which being pent,
would continue the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Particles, and detain them, ſo that
they would not eaſily precipitate, but on every occaſion beget reiterated
Fermentations, until at length not only the more groſs, but alſo the moſt
pure colour'd, and deſirable parts would precipitate, and the <hi>Cyder</hi>
left pale, jejune, and ill taſted: Or which oftentimes happens, the Solution
is ſo forcible, that it remains thick, pale, eager, and ill taſted,
unleſs it be by Art refined, which ſpoils all <hi>Cyder</hi> that
otherwiſe would be good.</p>
               <p>As for the time of it ſtanding open, that muſt be
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned according to the Nature of the Fruit, and their Circumſtances.
For if the Fruit were hard that the Liquor came out of the Preſs
indifferently clear, the leſs time may ſerve; for then will it let fall its
Feces the ſooner: But if the Fruit were mellow or pulpy, or the Weather mild
and warm, then will it with more Difficulty part with its groſs Particles,
and ſo the longer time is required; and therefore it will be convenient
ſometimes to inſpect your <hi>Cyder,</hi> to obſerve in what ſtate or
condition of Fineneſs it is, from time to time; for as ſoon as it is Fine,
it is beſt forthwith to draw it into Bottles, or rack it into other
Veſſels, leſt a new Fermentation happen.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. You may try its fineneſs by taking a
<hi>Glaſs Pipe</hi> of a Foot or more in length, that's open at both ends, by
ſtopping the upper end of the <hi>Pipe</hi> with your Thumb, and letting the
other end down into the <hi>Cyder</hi> as deep as you think fit, then open the
upper end by raiſing your Thumb, the <hi>Cyder</hi> will riſe in the
<hi>Pipe;</hi> then ſtop the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end again with your Thumb, and elevate
the <hi>Pipe,</hi> ſo<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93773:6"/>may you let it run into a
Drinking-glaſs, or return it into the Veſſel, after you have viewed it,
as you think fit.</p>
               <p>By this means you may know the different Degrees of Fineneſs,
in the upper, middle, and lower parts of the Veſſel, without tapping in
ſeveral places; for the <hi>Cyder</hi> may not be all alike fine at once; and
it is beſt to let it be alike fine before you draw it off.</p>

its <hi>Lee,</hi> as is before directed, which you may call its firſt
racking; and may be done into large Glaſs Bottles of one or two Gallon apiece
more or leſs; let it ſtand in ſuch Bottles a Month or two, or more; let
them be looſe ſtopt, that there may be a free admiſſion of Air though
not of Duſt or other Filth; ſet theſe Bottles in your Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or cold
Repoſitory, (yet ſo that they may not freeze) and there will your
<hi>Cyder</hi> undergo a ſecond degree of Fineing, and other Feces will
precipitate, which when you obſerve to be throughly ſetled in the bottom,
and your <hi>Cyder</hi> very tranſparent, which you may call
<hi>Superfine,</hi> then is ſuch <hi>Cyder</hi> fit for uſe.</p>
               <p>For it is obſerv'd, that the coldneſs of the Glaſs very
much accelerates the precipitation of the remaining Lee or Feces, leaving only
the true Balſamick tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Juice of the Apple, which by any other ways
or means is hardly ſeparable without impairing the <hi>Cyder:</hi> Therefore
if your quantity of <hi>Cyder</hi> be ſo<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93773:7"/>great, that you
cannot eaſily obtain a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of large Glaſs Bottles, you may
inſtead of them make uſe of Stone Bottles, or glazed Earthen Veſſels,
the larger the better, which may be placed in Rows in your Cellars or Vaults,
and covered with Boards, or the like, to keep your <hi>Cyder</hi> from the
Duſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not from the Air; but in theſe Veſſels you
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo well diſcern the fining of your <hi>Cyder,</hi> as in Glaſs

               <p>When one Bottle is full, you may with your Finger ſtop the
